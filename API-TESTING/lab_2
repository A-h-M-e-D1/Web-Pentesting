##Exploiting server-side parameter pollution in a query string

Steps:
 1-try to find api endpoint but we can't 
 2-try to get useful error from login page but faild
 3-check reset passsword 
   .1-enter 'administrator' and we get response 200 that determine 
      type of filed and email

   . if enter invalid username get Invalid username
    
   .check source code and then found /static/js/forgotPassword.js
    after analysis this found if can reset password then we need token
     to change password

   .pollution input username
    => username=administrator&filed=x#

    this arise error as we need to encode this character
    => username=administrator%26filed=x%23

    this appear error as not there exist x filed 
    try email will appear response 200 as this valid filed
    => username=administrator%26filed=email%23

   .try field reset_token 
    => username=administrator%26filed=reset_token%23
     this success and return token then take it and reset_password
