# this conatin notes of business logic flow and notes from writupes
--------------------------------------------------------------------
// The business logic flow can't detect by scanners
// The business logic exists in 
   [ "paremeter tampering" , " lack of validation , insufficient workflow validation  ]

// you can chain business logic flow with race condition
--------------------------------------------------------------------
# some real-life examples of business logic flows
1.Unlimited Wallet Balance Manipulation
  # how exploit this
    // target -> banking application  
    /* this flaw lies on the application's mechanism of handling transaction requests 
     and workflow validation processes */ 

  # steps to reproduce this vulnerability
    // step 1 : make a request to approve.html endpoint 
                   #GET /windcave/approve.html?sessionid=123364848
                   this redirects to the 
                  #transaction.execute this responsible for approving the transaction
                
    // step 2 : before redirect occurs , intercept the request and visit cancel.html endpint 
               to cancel the transaction
               #GET /windcave/cancel.html?sessionid=123364848
               
    // step 3 : copies the session ID from the previous requests
    // step 4 : change endpoint from "cancel.html" to :approve.html" and use the 
                same  sessionid this can add money random to target account
 
2.Transaction Duplication vulnerability
  # idea is check if you can send money for yourself
  # steps to reproduce this vulnerability
    // make request to endpoint example:
        POST /api/transfer
    // the body of request contains 
        {  "reciever_account": ""  , "sender_account:""    }
        suppose if the sender_account is " 46452132"
        try to add to reciever_account and check response
        {  "reciever_account": "46452132"  , "sender_account:"46452132"    }
        if success and  found the money transfered to the same account then it's vulnerable
